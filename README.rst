abl-mode
========

The abl-mode is a minor mode for python programmers who develop using
virtual environments, version control branches and unit tests.

What does it do?
----------------

Abl-mode is ideal for developers who switch development branches
frequently, and create python virtual environments for these
individual branches. When you run a test with ``C-c t`` or start a
server with ``C-c r``, abl-mode checks the availability of a virtual
environment for the branch you're on. The name of the virtual
environment is determined according to the name of the project and the
VCS branch. If there is no such virtual environment, the user is
prompted either for the name of a replacement virtual environment, or
``y`` for creating a new virtual environment. Once you've run a test,
and made some changes depending on the results, you can rerun the same
test with ``C-c u``.

Installing
----------

To install abl-mode, put abl.el on your elisp path, and include the
following in your emacs configuration file::

   (require 'abl-mode)

If you want to activate abl-mode automatically for python files, add
the following to your Emacs configuration::

   (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'abl-mode-hook)

You can replace find-file-hooks with python-mode-hook if you want to
activate abl-mode only for python files.

=============
Running Tests
=============

Here is how the tests to run are determined:

If the name of the file does not match ``abl-mode-test-file-regexp``,
it is assumed that this is not a test file, but a code file. In that
case, the beginning of the file is searched (using the regular
expressions in ``abl-mode-code-file-tests-regexps``) for a line that
lists the tests for that file. The format for this line is ``tests:
wherever/the_tests_are.py``. If no such header is found, an error is
shown.

If the file is a test file, which test is run depends on the location
of the cursor. If it is at the start of the file, the whole file is
run. If it is in an individual test, that test is run. If it is in a
test class but not in a test, that test class is run.

=============
Customization
=============

You can set any of the following options either by including a line
such as the following in your .emacs file::

    (setq option-name new-value)

Or by listing project-local customization options in a file named
`.abl` at the base level of a project, i.e. where the `setup.py` file
is located. The customization line in such a file should start with
the option name, followed by the value, such as::

    abl-mode-test-command "ENV_VAR=\"env var value\"" pytest -x %s"

As you can see here, the value should be as you would include it in
your configuration; it is read and evaluated, so that logical values
such as nil or t can also be used. String formatting is similar to the
way it is done in Python; %s gets replaced by the relevant value when
the option gets used.
